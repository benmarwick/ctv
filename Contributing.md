## Contributing to a task view

Contributions to task views are very welcome, for instance to suggest new content, or
improvements in existing content. Each published task view includes the email address of
its maintainer, and contributions may be sent by email to the maintainer. You are 
encouraged to engage by raising an issue, providing a pull request or a patch if 
you as contributor are comfortable with this, and where a link to a repository
holding the task view source under version control is given.

As an example, if you spot bad phrasing or inaccuracy in the [Spatial](https://cran.r-project.org/view=Spatial) or 
[SpatioTemporal](https://cran.r-project.org/view=SpatioTemporal)
Task Views, you may email the maintainer, or if a [Github](https://github.com) user,
raise an issue on the task view repoisitory [https://github.com/r-spatial/task_views](https://github.com/r-spatial/task_views),
or fork the repository, edit locally following the [guidelines](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/)
and make a pull request.
