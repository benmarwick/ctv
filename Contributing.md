## Contributing to a CRAN task view

Contributions to task views from members of the community are very welcome and in fact
crucial for keeping the task views up to date. Typical contributions would be improvements
in existing content (e.g., adding details, clarifications, or corrections) or suggestions of additional
content (e.g., packages or links). To facilitate such contributions each task view includes
the e-mail address of the principal maintainer as well as a link to the associated
GitHub repository.

Thus, to make a contribution either:

* **Send an e-mail** to the principal maintainer.

Or as a GitHub user employ one of the following alternatives:

* **Raise an issue** in the GitHub repository.
* **Provide a pull request** in the GitHub repository.
